written python code based on below reuqirements:

Suppose the course grade is based on 30 assignments (each scored 0 to 100), three projects (each scored 0 to 100),
and attendance in 15 classes (each scored as present or absent). The assignments account for 30% of the course grade,
the projects are 20% each (60% total), and attendance is 10% of the course grade. Suppose 10 of the 30 assignments
are included in the final course score. The 10 are randomly selected.
